# Project Implementation Plan: RISC-V Assembly Routines

## Component 1: Unsigned Multiplication

### Objective
Develop an assembly routine to multiply two unsigned 32-bit numbers using the RISC-V RV32I ISA. The system must output the lower 32 least significant bits of the product.

### Implementation Requirements
The routine must rely solely on instructions present in the provided RV32I reference sheet. The use of multiplication extensions (mul, mulh, muls, mulu) is prohibited. Additionally, the use of pseudoinstructions such as mv or ret is not permitted.

### Algorithm
The implementation must optimize for execution speed and compactness. A linear time complexity solution (repeated addition) is not acceptable. The routine must implement a shift-and-add algorithm (or equivalent logarithmic complexity method) to perform the calculation efficiently.

### Output
The final 32-bit result must be stored in the designated memory word c.

## Component 2: Sobel Operator

### Objective
Develop an assembly routine to apply the Sobel operator to a 5x5 matrix of signed 32-bit numbers using the RV32I ISA. This operation approximates derivatives for horizontal and vertical changes in image processing by performing convolutions with specific kernels.

### Kernel Definitions
The process requires two 3x3 kernels, Gx and Gy, defined as follows:

Gx =
[ -1  0 +1 ]
[ -2  0 +2 ]
[ -1  0 +1 ]

Gy =
[ -1 -2 -1 ]
[  0  0  0 ]
[ +1 +2 +1 ]

### Convolution Process
The convolution involves sweeping a 3x3 kernel across the 5x5 source matrix with a stride of 1.

1. Select a 3x3 window from the source matrix.
2. Perform element-wise multiplication between the source window and the kernel.
3. Sum the resulting values to generate a single output element.
4. Shift the window by the stride and repeat until the entire matrix is processed.

For example, using a source matrix A and kernel B, the first operation aligns the top-left 3x3 window of A with B, computes the products, and sums them to create the first entry of the output.

### Final Output Computation
The Sobel filter requires the convolution of the source matrix with both Gx and Gy independently. The final output is generated by combining these two results.

Add the output matrix from the Gx convolution to the output matrix from the Gy convolution element-wise.

C_final[row][col] = Result_Gx[row][col] + Result_Gy[row][col]

### Output
The resulting 3x3 matrix must be stored in the memory word array c.
